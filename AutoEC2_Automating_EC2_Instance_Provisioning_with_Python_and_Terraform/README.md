## Automating EC2 Instance Provisioning on AWS Using Python, Boto3, and Terraform (On Ubuntu)

Hey there, fellow techie! Have you ever wished for a magical way to create an EC2 instance on AWS without the manual labor? Well, you're in luck! We're about to embark on a journey of automation using the dynamic trio: Python, Boto3, and Terraform. And guess what? We're doing this on Ubuntu. So, buckle up and let's dive right in.

### What You Need

First things first, make sure your Ubuntu setup is ready for this adventure:

1. **AWS Account:** If you don't already have one, head over to AWS and create an account. You'll need access keys to communicate with AWS programmatically.
2. **Python and Boto3:** Lucky for us, Python comes pre-installed on Ubuntu. But we need to get Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. Open your terminal and type:
   ```bash
   pip3 install boto3
   ```
3. **Terraform:** Ubuntu makes it easy-peasy to get Terraform too. Open that trusty terminal and enter:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install terraform
   ```

### Step 1: Setting Up AWS Credentials

Before we start, let's ensure AWS recognizes us. Here's what you do:

1. Create an IAM user on AWS with programmatic access and the necessary EC2 permissions.
2. Open your terminal and set your AWS credentials as environment variables:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key>
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<desired-region>
   ```
   
### Step 2: EC2 Instance Blueprint with Terraform

Alright, let's lay the groundwork using Terraform. Create a file named `ec2_instance.tf` and let's work some Terraform magic:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "ec2_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0da59f1af71ea4ad2"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "aws_login"
}
```

### Step 3: Python Script to Rule Them All

Now, let's bring in Python and Boto3 to orchestrate this symphony of automation. Create a file named `provision_ec2.py` and paste in this enchanting script:

```python
import subprocess
import json
import boto3

def update_terraform_file(instance_type, ami):
    with open("ec2_instance.tf", "r") as file:
        tf_content = file.read()

    data = json.loads(tf_content)

    data["resource"]["aws_instance"]["ec2_instance"]["instance_type"] = instance_type
    data["resource"]["aws_instance"]["ec2_instance"]["ami"] = ami

    with open("ec2_instance.tf", "w") as file:
        json.dump(data, file, indent=2)

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    region_name='us-east-1'
)

ec2_client = session.client('ec2')

response = ec2_client.describe_images(
    Owners=['amazon'],
    Filters=[
        {'Name': 'name', 'Values': ['ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-*']},
        {'Name': 'state', 'Values': ['available']}
    ]
)

sorted_images = sorted(response['Images'], key=lambda x: x['CreationDate'], reverse=True)
latest_ami_id = sorted_images[0]['ImageId']

update_terraform_file("t2.micro", latest_ami_id)

subprocess.run(["terraform", "init"])
subprocess.run(["terraform", "apply", "-auto-approve"])
```

### Step 4: Let the Magic Begin!

It's showtime! Here's how you set your magic spell into motion:

1. Open your terminal on Ubuntu and navigate to the directory containing your `provision_ec2.py` script and the `ec2_instance.tf` file.
2. Summon the spirits of automation by typing:
   ```bash
   python3 provision_ec2.py
   ```

Voila! Watch as the script dances with Terraform and Boto3 to conjure an EC2 instance right before your eyes. Your AWS-powered creation will come to life, all thanks to your coding prowess!

### In Conclusion

You've just embarked on an enchanting journey into the realm of automation using Python, Boto3, and Terraformâ€”right here on your trusty Ubuntu setup. Remember, the possibilities are endless with this trio, so keep exploring and automating your way to success. Happy coding, magician! ðŸŽ©ðŸª„

P.S. Don't forget to give your creation a cool name, like "Automagical EC2 Conjurer." ðŸ˜‰
